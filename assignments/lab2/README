	To compile your parser program type:

	% make parser

	This produces an executable named "parser" which is standalone
	phase of the Cool compiler.  It requires lexer, semant, and cgen
	to do anything useful.

	To test your parser on a file 'foo.cl' type

	% myparser foo.cl

	myparser is a shell script that "glues" together lexer and
	parser using pipes.

	To run your parser on the files good.cl and bad.cl type:

	% make dotest

	To run the (provided) lexer and your parser on a file called test.cl type:

	% ./lexer test.cl | ./parser

	If you think your parser is correct and behaves like
	the one we wrote, you may want to run a COOL compiler using
	your parser:

	% mycoolc foo.cl

	To overwrite the default lexical analyzer with yours, replace 
	lexer (which is a symbolic link to the "official" lexer) with
        your lexer from PA2.

	If you change architectures you must issue

	% make clean
